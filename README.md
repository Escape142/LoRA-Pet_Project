# LoRA-Pet_Project: Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA 🚀

Welcome to the LoRA-Pet_Project! Our mission is to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technology, specifically tailored for domain-specific tasks. This project focuses on the accurate interpretation and translation of mixed-language technical specifications into catalog entries.

## 📘 Project Overview

Our domain frequently encounters inputs that combine Russian and English terminology, along with precise technical specifications such as DN sizes, fittings, and ГОСТ standards. The primary challenge is to process these inputs accurately to provide detailed product information, including units of measurement, composition, length, and specific fittings.

### 🎯 Example Task

**Objective:** Efficiently translate detailed customer inquiries into accurate catalog positions.

#### Dataset Illustration:

- **Input:** `Рукав 15,9-110-1000-0,2-11/11-М27х1,5`
- **Output:**
  - **Ед. Изм. (Unit of Measurement):** шт. (piece)
  - **Простая/составная (Simple/Compound):** Составная (Compound)
  - **Продукт/рукав (Product/Hose):** 2SN DN16
  - **Длина (Length):** 1000
  - **Фитинг левый (Left Fitting):** DKOL27X1,5DN16
  - **Фитинг правый (Right Fitting):** DKOL27X1,5DN16

- **Input:** `РВД HDB520-PA420SF9V4A-90-920X/GEVS`
- **Output:**
  - **Ед. Изм. (Unit of Measurement):** шт. (piece)
  - **Простая/составная (Simple/Compound):** Составная (Compound)
  - **Продукт/рукав (Product/Hose):** 4SH DN19
  - **Длина (Length):** 920
  - **Фитинг левый (Left Fitting):** SFS41,3DN19
  - **Фитинг правый (Right Fitting):** SFS41,3(90)DN19
