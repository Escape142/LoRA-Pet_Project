# LoRA-Pet_Project: Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA üöÄ

Welcome to the LoRA-Pet_Project! Our mission is to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technology, specifically tailored for domain-specific tasks. This project focuses on the accurate interpretation and translation of mixed-language technical specifications into catalog entries.

## üìò Project Overview

Our domain frequently encounters inputs that combine Russian and English terminology, along with precise technical specifications such as DN sizes, fittings, and –ì–û–°–¢ standards. The primary challenge is to process these inputs accurately to provide detailed product information, including units of measurement, composition, length, and specific fittings.

### üéØ Example Task

**Objective:** Efficiently translate detailed customer inquiries into accurate catalog positions.
